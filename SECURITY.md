# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

ChipCliff Collaborative Framework takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, policies, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### **Environment-Based Configuration**
- ✅ All API keys are stored in environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Configuration validation with placeholder detection
- ✅ Secure config.yaml with `${ENV_VAR}` substitution

### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- ✅ Pydantic models for request validation
- ✅ API key format verification
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (future database features)
- ✅ XSS protection in web interfaces

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ API key validation and format checking
- 🔄 JWT-based authentication (planned)
- 🔄 Role-based access control (planned)
- 🔄 Rate limiting implementation (planned)

### **Data Protection**
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore to prevent credential commits
- ✅ Secure error handling without credential exposure
- ✅ Structured logging without sensitive data
- ✅ Environment variable validation

### **Dependencies & Supply Chain**
- ✅ Pinned dependency versions in requirements.txt
- ✅ Regular dependency updates
- 🔄 Automated vulnerability scanning (planned)
- 🔄 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) (planned)

## 🚨 Security Fixes Applied During Migration

During the migration from the original ChipCliff project, the following critical security issues were identified and fixed:

### **CRITICAL: Hardcoded API Keys Removed**
**Issue**: The original `config/config.yaml` contained hardcoded API keys in plaintext format.

**Security Risk**: 
- API keys exposed in version control
- Potential unauthorized access to LLM services
- Violation of API provider terms of service

**Fix Applied**:
1. ❌ Excluded insecure config.yaml from copy operation
2. ✅ Created secure config.yaml using environment variable substitution
3. ✅ Added API key validation and format checking
4. ✅ Created comprehensive .env.example template

### **Enhanced Configuration Security**
**Improvements**:
- Environment variable substitution with `${VAR_NAME}` syntax
- Validation prevents placeholder values from being used
- Clear error messages for missing environment variables
- Support for .env file loading

### **Git Security**
**Added Protection**:
- Comprehensive .gitignore covering all sensitive file types
- Prevention of accidental credential commits
- Multiple environment file patterns excluded

## 🔐 Environment Variables

### **Required Variables**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-deepseek-key-here
```

### **Optional Variables**
```bash
DEBUG=false
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

- [ ] Logging doesn't contain credentials

### **Production Security**
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS encryption enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **How to Report**
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email us at: security@chipcliff-framework.com
4. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### **What to Include**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### **Response Timeline**
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
